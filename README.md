textdrop
========

Textdrop is a plugin to make awesome text animation based on your mouse pointer or your touch on screen.

If you wanna see it in action, you can either go to http://jacktorrancetrip.com, which isthe project that inspired its creation,
or to http://ottonascarella.github.io/textdrop

Please note that the licence for this is GPL, so if you make changes,
send it back to us so we can improve what's already here. 


Cheers,
