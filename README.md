textdrop
========

Textdrop is a plugin to make awesome text animation based on your mouse pointer or your touch on screen.

If you wanna see it in action, go to http://jacktorrancetrip.com, the project that inspired its creation.

Please note that the licence for this is GPL, so use it as you wish.
if you make changes, send it back to me so we can improve what's already here. 


Cheers,


Otto Nascarella
